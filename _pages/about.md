I am a PhD student in the [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://artsci.tamu.edu/atmos-science/index.html) at the [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/). I work on tropical cyclones and climate change. My faculty advisor is [Prof. Robert Korty](https://artsci.tamu.edu/atmos-science/contact/profiles/robert-korty.html).

I am seeking a full-time job in weather, climate, machine learning, data science, or software engineering to leverage academic expertise and technical skills to pursue meaningful solutions. Feel free to contact me if you have any opportunities!
